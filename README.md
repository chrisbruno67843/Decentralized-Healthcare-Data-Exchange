### Record Exchange Contract
Facilitates the secure transfer of medical information between authorized parties, maintaining data integrity and confidentiality throughout the process.

### Access Tracking Contract
Creates an immutable audit trail of all data access events, enhancing transparency and accountability within the healthcare ecosystem.
